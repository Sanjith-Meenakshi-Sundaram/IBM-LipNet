# IBM-LipNet
LipNet is a deep learning model for visual speech recognition, transcribing spoken words from video by focusing on lip movements. It combines CNNs for spatial feature extraction and RNNs for temporal sequence modeling. LipNet offers potential applications in accessibility for hearing impairments and improving voice recognition technologies.
